**Description**
We developed a web appliation using the ReactJS framework. Maintained by Facebook and a community of developers, it is a constantly developing JavaScript library that makes creating interactive UIs very simple and revolves around building encapsulated components that manage their own states. Using this framework, we created a Flagship Smartphone Quiz that quizzes users on features they believe are important in a new, expensive phone and gives them suggestions based on their answers. This application includes a full layout on the start page, question cards, and end page created with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the framework. The answer choices in the quiz correspond with a point-based system that outputs a suggested smartphone based on the number of points recieved. Because we used CodeSandbox, an online code editor that provides programmers with a URL of our application, our application can be easily accesed through a simple web URL. We acquired the skills to develop this application, especially the skills in ReactJS, using a course by freeCodeCamp.org. The link to the course is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44.
